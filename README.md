We are emergencies and technology<br>
SaveMeNow is an application that connects your mobile phone with the nearest fire emergency service quickly and efficiently.<br>

In the event of an incident, SaveMeNow sends data in real time, manually or automatically, to the nearest 1-1-2. This mobile application allows the intervention team to have updated information that until now was impossible to know in advance , favoring much more agile and efficient action.<br><br>

SaveMeNow is designed for active prevention and works before, during and after an incident.<br><br>


Why SaveMeNow?<br>
Our mission is to save lives through faster and more effective emergency assistance thanks to technology. But we will only achieve it with your support. SaveMeNow was born after years of experience of firefighters in rescue operations, firefighting or accidents, among others.<br><br>

How do we do it?<br>
Through an application on your mobile that automatically connects your phone with the nearest fire service and any 1-1-2 center throughout Europe. In reality it is something more complex, but we already take care of that.<br><br>

Why an emergency App?<br>
Because the data we send through an emergency application can save lives or minimize the effects of the incident. Register and when the App is available we will notify you so you can be one of the first to try it.
